    "## Why Good Code Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from a local prototype to a production-grade machine learning model requires a fundamental shift in coding standards. High-quality code acts as insurance against technical debt when projects scale or integrate with larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integration and Production:** Good code is critical when your work must interface with larger systems, shared packages, or tools used by other scientists.\n",
    "* **The \"One-Off\" Fallacy:** While \"hacking\" is acceptable for immediate, one-time demos, prototypes are rarely ever run only once. Code written in haste almost always resurfaces for future projects.\n",
    "* **Combatting \"Bit-Rot\":** Code decays over time as dependencies (libraries, OS, APIs) evolve. Well-structured code makes the necessary \"modernization\" process significantly less painful.\n",
    "* **Scalability Value:** As a codebase grows in complexity, the dividends paid by clean, documented code increase exponentially."
