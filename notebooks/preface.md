## Reading Guide

Here is the reading guide for this book, outlining how to navigate its chapters based on your specific needs and the dependencies between topics.

* **Priority of Chapter 1:** Readers are strongly encouraged to start with the first chapter, as it establishes the fundamentals of "good code," introduces core themes, and sets up recurring code examples.
* **Reading Flexibility:** Most chapters are designed to be modular and can be read independently, allowing for a non-linear approach to the book.
* **Sequential Dependencies:** There are specific prerequisites for certain chapters to ensure technical continuity:
* Read Chapter **2** $\rightarrow$ Chapter **3**.
* Read Chapters **6, 7, 10, and 11** $\rightarrow$ Chapter **12**.

* **Optional Machine Learning Content:** Specialized sections marked with "**ML**" provide deep dives into machine learning. These are optional and can be skipped by those not working in the ML field without affecting the understanding of the core material.
